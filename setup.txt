Getting the Jetson up and running:

-Flash system with Jetpack
-Install Grinch kernal (for wifi and for ROS, at least)
-Copy libs from /usr/local/cuda-*.*/lib to /usr/lib
-Get the directory of armhf ueye drivers
-rsync the drivers to their proper locations
-sudo apt-get install libqt4-qt3support to get ueyedemo running
-Restart the computer so that ueyeusb daemon can start
-Install ros for ARM - seems OK, I think...
-apt-get install ros-indigo-image-transport
-apt-get install ros-indigo-camera-calibration-parsers
-apt-get install ros-indigo-cv-bridge
