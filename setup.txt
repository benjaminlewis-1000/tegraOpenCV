Getting the Jetson up and running:

-Flash system with Jetpack
	-Might need to push CUDA stuff: Use this website https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/838813/unable-to-push-cuda-opencv-to-jetson-tk1/
-Install Grinch kernal (for wifi and for ROS, at least)
	-http://jetsonhacks.com/2015/05/26/install-grinch-kernel-for-l4t-21-3-on-nvidia-jetson-tk1/
-(Copy libs from /usr/local/cuda-*.*/lib to /usr/lib)
-Get the directory of armhf ueye drivers
-rsync the drivers to their proper locations
-sudo apt-get install libqt4-qt3support to get ueyedemo running
-Restart the computer so that ueyeusb daemon can start
-Install ros for ARM - seems OK, I think...
-apt-get install ros-indigo-image-transport
-apt-get install ros-indigo-camera-calibration-parsers
-apt-get install ros-indigo-cv-bridge
-sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-tf
-Run ros_packages.sh in relNavScripts/installation
-apt-get install ros-indigo-joy
-apt-get install ros-indigo-tf-conversions
-apt-get install ros-indigo-image-geometry
-apt-get install ros-indigo-eigen-conversions
